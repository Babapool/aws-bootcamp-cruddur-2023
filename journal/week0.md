# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Overview

During this week's live stream, we discussed about AWS billing, AWS architecture and AWS security. We also talked about the app (Cruddur) we are going to build. We also talked about the various different personas of the stakeholders involved in the making of this app.

We also leaned about the Iron Triangle which has 3 vertices to determine the Quality of your project. The three vertices are:
- Scope (Features, functionality)
- Cost (Budgets, Resources)
- Time (Schedule)

So if we want something quick and scope the scope of the project will be limited. This triangle tells about the various tradeoffs that one may occur while managing a project.

In the next part we learned about **"What is Good Architecture?"**:
- The project **Must** achieve some requirements which can either be technical or business oriented.
- Those requirements must be:
  - Verifiable
  - Monitorable
  - Traceable
  - Feasible
- It should address the _Risks_,_Assumptions_ and _Constraints_ of the project.

All in all this in the end in some ways ties in with the concept of the Iron Triangle.

Then we learnt about the diffent types of designs:
1. Conceptual Design: Business requirements/Concept translated into ways that can be understand by non techincal people whichh includes the way the product will function.
1. Logical Design: This is a zommed in version of the Conceptual design. It defines how the system should be implemented, included the enviroments and services to be used. It is the blueprint of the product.
1. Physical Design: It is actual represented on the product that is going to be bulit, which will be understood by the technical working on it.

Finally we learned about the __AWS Well-Architected Framework__. The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of practice which you can use to review your AWS workloads againsts standard AWS best practices.

It has 6 operational pillars:
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainability

### Create an Admin User

The AWS account we create is the _Root Account_. It is advisble to use your Root Account as minimally as possible. Instead we can create an _IAM User_  having Admin Access by assign the  `AdminstratorAccess` Policy.

1. Go the [IAM User Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users).
1. Select the User option and click on the `Add Users` button.
1.  Add the `User name`.
1. Check the button to provide the user aacess to the Management Console
1.You can either autogenerate or use a custom password to login into the Console. You can optionally choose the user to set a new password at the next sign-in.

1. Now we need to add your user to a group. In this group we will add the permission required for our new user
  - Add the name of your group.
  - Select the `AdministratorAccess` policy and click on the `Create user group`.
1. Select the group in which we want to add the user.
![Creation of IAM User - Step 2](assets/IAM-User-Step2.png)
1. Review your changes and then create the _IAM User_.
1. Retrieve your User name and Console password with Console sign-in URL.

### Generate AWS Credentials for IAM Users
 We need to generate the credentials of the IAM user we have created. These credentials consists of the `Access key` (like username) and `Secret access key` (like password). We can use these credentails to use AWS programmatically through the AWS CLI (CLI version of AWS). Follow these steps:
 1. Choose the user for which you want to generate the credentials.
 1. Scroll down to the `Access keys` section and select the `Create access key` option.
 1. Select the `Command Line Interface (CLI)` option.
 ![Step 1](assets/Credentials-Step1.png)
 1. You can set optional description tag.
 ![Step 2](assets/Credentials-Step2.png)
 1. Select `Create access key` to generate the credentials.
 1. Retrieve/download your credentials.
